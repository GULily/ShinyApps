# ShinyApps
Two Shiny applications developed during the semester 2017 Spring as a research assistant working for Prof. Voeten.


For the application UNPredictor, here is a temporary developing link: https://erikvoeten.shinyapps.io/unvotepredictor/.
One can upload the sample files "nktestvote2014.csv" and "nktestvote2015.csv" to test this application.


For the application UNVoteAnalyzer, here is a temporary developing link: https://yili.shinyapps.io/developing/.
